# A1n Models

## Statistical Quark Model

The nucleon is seen as a gas of massless partons in equilibrium at a given 
temperature in a finite volume. The parton distribution also contains a diffractive term, 
which is not featured in other models of A1. Based on this parameterization, a global 
NLO QCD analysis is performed for both unpolarized and polarized DIS data to obtain 
the best set of parameters, of which there are only eight.

## Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL)-Like Models 

The chiral soliton framework is used in the low-energy, non-perturbative regime, 
where the assumptions and calculations of pQCD are not valid. Here, we discuss chiral 
symmetry breaking, and how the nucleon is modeled as an object known as a chiral soliton.

The QCD Lagrangian written using Nf massless flavors is known to have a global symmetry 
under unitary flavor transformations which mixes states of left- and right-handed quark 
fields according to UL(Nf) x UR(Nf) rotations, referred to as chiral symmetry. 
If chiral symmetry was an exact symmetry, then a degeneracy in parity of all states 
for otherwise equal quantum numbers would be expected. However, in nature, this does not
occur; mass differences (splittings) between states of the same quantum numbers but 
opposite parities are large.  To treat the nucleon under the formalism of chirality, 
one can generalize QCD to an arbitrary large number of colors, NC. 

In NJL models (so named after the original authors), hadronic currents are described 
by quark degrees of freedom which are functionals of solitonic meson fields. The dynamics 
are governed by a U(1) x SU(2)L Ã— SU(2)R chiral symmetry. In such a model, baryons 
are viewed as "mesonic lumps," compared to the quark-parton model, where baryons are 
composites of nearly non-interacting, point-like quarks.

In these NJL-type models, the mean-field quark wave functions--immersed in a background 
consisting of a chiral soliton--is a representation of a non-trivial coupling of spin 
and isospin; this is in stark contrast to bag models, which describe baryons in terms 
of direct products of spin and isospin states.
